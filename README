Build dependencies
===================================
It is probably sufficient to run:
  sudo apt-get build-dep mingw32
  sudo apt-get install fakeroot

Updating version information
===================================
There are currently three places that need to be touched in order to build a
Debian package for a new version. They are:
  - build.sh
  - debian/changelog
  - debian/control

Update build.sh so that the correct versions are defined for the MinGW sources
and all the required 3rd party libs.

Update the debian files to update the versions you've defined in build.sh. Also
increment the Debian package version.

Building
===================================
Finally, to build everything run the following:
  ./build.sh | tee build.log
